## Call me Joe
The band are a group dedicated to playing for fun, but just recently they did not have as many bookings as they had hoped for. 

The Band's current website was set up by one of the band members, a standard wordpress template.
Having interviewed the group I learned that the band are deadly serious about their music and want to increase the bookings to at least one or two a month.

### Assignment 
To capture the hart and sole of the band on a one page website targeted at puba & clubs.
