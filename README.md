Call me Joe
The band are a group dedicated to just playing for fun, but just recently they have not had as many bookings as they had hoped. Their goal is to have at least one booking per month. For them playing means more than just money. Their current website was set up by one of the band members, a standard wordpress template.

Having interviewed the group I learned that the band are deadly serious about their music. The band has been an anchor providing a solid grip through good and bad times.

The assignment is to capture the hart and sole of the band in the website and bring in more bookings.

UX
To achieve this goal I needed to apply a no nonsense attitude. Not too many frills, just the basics. Key words being: Modern Fresh Retro Emotional.

The first section uses a clean black & white image instantly showing the magnetism of “Call me Joe” The logo and heading have been restyled and set in gold.

The navigation lets us click smoothly to each section using an (ease in/out javascript snippet)

In the body I have created a background compilation where we see scenes of the band playing with close-ups giving glimpses into their world of Rock & Roll. Each section is represented by a fresh transparent color connecting the whole site together. The logo was redesigned just using css and the font Anton from google fonts
